The Gym Management System is a simple program designed to help gyms manage users, memberships, and workout classes.
Users can log in as Admins, Trainers, or Members.
Each type of user has a different set of options, like buying memberships, creating workout classes, or viewing revenue.

This is a console-based program. You type choices using numbers or text to interact with the system.

Admins can view total membership revenue and manage users.
Trainers can create update and delete classes.
Members can view available classes and purchase memberships.
